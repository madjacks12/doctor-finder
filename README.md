# Doctor-Finder
#### _By Matthew Jackson, 2/16/2018_

This webpage finds doctos in the Portland, OR area that work with an issue the user specfies. The user can also lookup doctors by name.

## Getting Started

To run this webpage you will need to have Gulp and NodeJS installed on your computer.

## Setup

1. `$git clone https://github.com/madjacks12/doctor-finder`
2. Run `$ npm install` and `$ bower install` inside that directory.

## Usage
1. To start the browser syncing and file watching, just first run `$ gulp build` followed by  `$ gulp cssBuild`.
**Note:** I am unsure if the development server is live reloading correctly.

## Future development
Eventually this app will search the entire United States and link to the doctors' office's webpages.

## Bugs

No known bugs.
